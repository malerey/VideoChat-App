# Twilio Video chat

This is an example video chat application built with Twilio Video and React. 

## Preparing the application

Start by cloning or downloading the repo. 

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file by copying the `.env.example`.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Credentials

You will need your Twilio Account SID, an API key and secret, all of them available by seeting up a Twilio account. 

All of them should be added to the .env file.

## Running the application

Run the app with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will open in your browser at localhost:3000

## Extras

Twilio is a very powerful tool. This is a very simple sample app to showcase it's most basic capabilities, but it can be used for more complex needs. For example, you could let an user share his or her screen, make a live drawing-sharing app, set up a server to handle international calls with low latency, allow a call admin to remove participants from the call, and many others. Feel free to contact me if this is something that interests you, as I have made quite a lot of projects with this technology.
